\section*{Focus Research Statement}

  Discussions on the deluge of data created and consumed by society abound in current literature - and surely come as no surprise to the reader. As a result, there is no shortage of tools that purport to make sense of this sea of information. However, effectively communicating and understanding, complex, interrelated data is a daunting, and largely unsolved problem in visualization research. This proposal explores a novel approach which leverages our unique ability as humans to reason and use contextual knowledge to extract actionable information from large datasets. Our proposal focuses on tree and graph networks, a type of data often found in social networks,  biological pathways, and genealogical trees.
